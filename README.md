Nuclear [Nautilus](Nautilus.md) is a project by [Connor Vilenio](Connor%20Vilenio.md) to organize and build a knowledge base of engineering know-how- particularly for [Software Engineering](Software%20Engineering.md).  The name of the project is inspired by Connor's study of [Admiral Hyman G. Rickover](Admiral%20Hyman%20G.%20Rickover.md), the "Father of the Nuclear Navy" and one of the all-time greatest engineers in history.  Rickover oversaw the creation of the first nuclear-powered submarine, the USS Nautilus, a milestone and monument to the possibilities of enginering excelence.
